Description: A set of plugins for publishing and subscribing to sensor_msgs/Image topics in representations other than raw pixel data.
 For example, for viewing a stream of images off-robot, a video codec will give much lower bandwidth and latency. For low frame rate tranport of high-definition images, you might prefer sending them as JPEG or PNG-compressed form.
